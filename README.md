# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors Project
In this lab, I create an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

The project is made up of five Milestone, and these are captured in files provided above.

## Milestone 1: Setup the environment
We will be creating and activating the environment in conda terminal using the following codes:
* $ conda create --name presh
* $ conda activate presh

This environment will be called "presh". This is the environment where we will install and import the necessary python packages for the project. The downloaded libraries include opencv-python, tensorflow, and ipykernel. The code below shows how this was done.

## Milestone 2: Creating the model
This milestone will involve two tasks namely: Creating the image project model on [Teachable Machine] (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) , and downloading it. This model is called "keras_model.h5"
